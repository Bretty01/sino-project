If you have any concerns or questions, please don't be afraid to ask me.
Take your time, get used to how to use the development enviroment, don't be afraid to make some mistakes.
The most important thing of all is to have fun. If you are having a hard time, and do not want to do this anymore,
then you do not have to do this.
Thank you so much for wanting to do this project with me. It really means a lot that you want to do something like
this together with me. Just the fact that you went out of your way to create those mockups is already a lot more
than I would have asked out of you (and they were really high quality mockups as well)! So with that being said,
I believe you will figure out how to do the styling. You are a really smart and passionate person that I feel that
you can power through this. Just don't expect it to be very easy either.

Thanks for everything! I really do appreciate it <3
